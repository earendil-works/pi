### NLTPI-SEC-001 — Align security policy with NLT governance
**Status:** in_review  
**Owner:** Joshua W. Dorsey, Sr. / delegated coding agents  
**Summary:** Replace inherited Pi/Earendil-specific security guidance with an NLT-Pi policy. The update preserves the local execution/no-OS-sandbox warning while defining NLT's development, ASFDK foundation, harness, MCP, and AgentOS trust boundaries; enforcement-first requirements; prompt-injection criteria based on demonstrated impact; vulnerability scope; private reporting; and incident handling. The policy explicitly distinguishes documented security requirements from verified implementation.  
**PR:** Pending creation  
**Branch:** `docs/nlt-pi-security-policy`  
**Verification:** Documentation-only change. No runtime tests were run. Private reporting is directed to GitHub private vulnerability reporting / Security Advisories when available; no unverified email address was added.  
**Next action:** Review the policy for organizational disclosure contact and confirm private vulnerability reporting is enabled for the repository.

### NLTPI-ARCH-001 — ASFDK three-layer governance alignment
**Status:** active  
**Owner:** Joshua W. Dorsey, Sr.  
**Summary:** Maintain explicit separation between development governance, ASFDK harness enforcement, and ASFDK MCP integration governance.  
**Next action:** Keep repository documentation and agent profiles consistent with the actual package/runtime boundaries; do not infer enforcement from documentation alone.

## Resolved

### NLTPI-CONTRIB-001 — Remove repository-local contributor gate
**Status:** resolved  
**Owner:** Joshua W. Dorsey, Sr. / delegated coding agents  
**Summary:** Removed the inherited contributor auto-close/approval workflows and allowlist in the requested order, then removed local CONTRIBUTING.md so the organization-level default applies.  
**PR:** https://github.com/NeuroLift-Technologies/nlt-pi/pull/4  
**Resolution:** PR #4 merged to `main` on 2026-11-02. Branch protection and the two requested repository settings remain separate outstanding administrative work.

### NLTPI-GOV-001 — Repository governance adoption
**Status:** resolved  
**Owner:** Joshua W. Dorsey, Sr. / delegated coding agents  
**Summary:** Adapted the canonical NLT governance stack to NLT-Pi, including repository-specific OTOI, agent instructions, review and handoff artifacts, agent profiles, Claude Code configuration, and validation.  
**PR:** https://github.com/NeuroLift-Technologies/nlt-pi/pull/3  
**Resolution:** PR #3 merged to `main`.
