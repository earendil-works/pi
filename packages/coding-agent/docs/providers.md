# Providers

Most hosted providers support one or both of these authentication methods:

- Sign in through a browser or device flow backed by OAuth.
- Provide an API key.

Use `/login [provider]` to see the methods supported by a provider. Amazon Bedrock and Google Vertex AI can also use ambient cloud credentials.

## Authenticate interactively

Run `/login` and select a provider. Pi guides you through its OAuth or API-key flow and saves the resulting credential in [`auth.json`](configuration.md#agent-directory).

On a remote or headless machine, an OAuth callback may not reach the local process. When prompted, paste the final redirect URL or authorization code back into Pi.

Run `/logout` and select a provider to remove its stored credential. This does not unset environment variables, remove authentication from `models.json`, or revoke the credential at the provider.

`auth.json` can contain API keys and OAuth tokens. Keep it private and do not commit it.

## Use an API key from the environment

Environment variables are useful in CI and anywhere Pi should not store the key. Set the variable before starting Pi:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
pi
```

This table covers providers with a single primary API-key variable. Providers that need additional configuration or support ambient credentials are covered under [Provider Specific Config](#provider-specific-config).

| Provider | Environment variable |
|---|---|
| Anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| Ant Ling | `ANT_LING_API_KEY` |
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| DeepSeek | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` |
| NVIDIA NIM | `NVIDIA_API_KEY` |
| Google Gemini | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| GitHub Copilot | `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| Mistral | `MISTRAL_API_KEY` |
| Groq | `GROQ_API_KEY` |
| Cerebras | `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` |
| xAI | `XAI_API_KEY` |
| OpenRouter | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| Vercel AI Gateway | `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` |
| ZAI Coding Plan (Global) | `ZAI_API_KEY` |
| ZAI Coding Plan (China) | `ZAI_CODING_CN_API_KEY` |
| OpenCode Zen and Go | `OPENCODE_API_KEY` |
| Radius | `RADIUS_API_KEY` |
| TypeSafe ([classifier models](models.md#use-classifier-models)) | `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` |
| Hugging Face | `HF_TOKEN` |
| Fireworks | `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` |
| Together AI | `TOGETHER_API_KEY` |
| Baseten | `BASETEN_API_KEY` |
| Kimi For Coding | `KIMI_API_KEY` |
| Meta | `META_API_KEY` |
| MiniMax | `MINIMAX_API_KEY` |
| MiniMax (China) | `MINIMAX_CN_API_KEY` |
| Moonshot AI (Global and China) | `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` |
| Qwen Token Plan and Individual | `QWEN_TOKEN_PLAN_API_KEY` |
| Qwen Token Plan (China) | `QWEN_TOKEN_PLAN_CN_API_KEY` |
| Xiaomi MiMo | `XIAOMI_API_KEY` |
| Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan (China) | `XIAOMI_TOKEN_PLAN_CN_API_KEY` |
| Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan (Amsterdam) | `XIAOMI_TOKEN_PLAN_AMS_API_KEY` |
| Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan (Singapore) | `XIAOMI_TOKEN_PLAN_SGP_API_KEY` |

Anthropic also recognizes `ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN` as an API credential and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` as bearer authentication.

With no key or token set, Anthropic uses workload identity federation when `ANTHROPIC_FEDERATION_RULE_ID`, `ANTHROPIC_ORGANIZATION_ID` and `ANTHROPIC_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` are set: the Anthropic SDK exchanges the identity token for a short-lived access token and refreshes it itself (re-reading the identity token file, so keep that file fresh for long sessions). `ANTHROPIC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID` are passed through when set.

## Load an API key from a command

To use a secret manager without writing the resolved key to disk, set a provider's `key` in `auth.json` to a command prefixed with `!`:

```json
{
  "anthropic": {
    "type": "api_key",
    "key": "!security find-generic-password -ws 'anthropic'"
  }
}
```

Pi runs the command when the key is first needed and caches its standard output for the process lifetime. Empty output, a timeout, or a nonzero exit leaves the key unresolved until Pi restarts.

## Provider Specific Config

The providers below have additional setup, need additional settings, or can use credentials supplied by their platform.

A stored API-key credential can include an `env` object. Its values take priority over the process environment for that provider:

```json
{
  "cloudflare-workers-ai": {
    "type": "api_key",
    "key": "...",
    "env": {
      "CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID": "account-id"
    }
  }
}
```

### Radius

Radius is a service crafted for Pi by the builders of Pi, Earendil Works. It provides a customizable AI gateway with organization-level controls and analytics built in, and artifacts for sharing what you create with Pi.

To get started, run `/login radius` in Pi. This adds Radius as a provider, and its models appear in `/model` like any other provider's.

Radius also has an MCP server, so Pi can manage Radius for you.

Radius is currently in early alpha and evolving quickly. See [radius.earendil.com](https://radius.earendil.com) for more.

Radius authentication uses its gateway catalog and caches refreshed model metadata for later offline startup. A custom Radius gateway configured in `models.json` uses its own catalog rather than inheriting the public `radius.pi.dev` catalog.

### OpenRouter

Pi uses authenticated `GET /api/v1/models/user` to filter built-in OpenRouter chat models in `/model` and `--list-models`, retaining Pi's capability metadata. This endpoint applies the key's guardrails, provider preferences, and privacy settings without requiring an organization toggle. See [OpenRouter's model discovery documentation](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api/api-reference/models/list-models-filtered-by-user-provider-preferences-privacy-settings-and-guardrails).

Until discovery succeeds, Pi shows the full OpenRouter catalog. Interactive mode discovers in the background at startup and when `/model` opens; `--list-models` waits for discovery for up to 15 seconds. The verified list stays in memory for the key that fetched it. Logging in with a different key shows the full catalog again until the next refresh. A successful empty response shows no OpenRouter chat models. If discovery fails, Pi keeps the last successful list. Offline mode makes no discovery requests. Discovery uses the same headers and base URL as model requests, including `models.json` overrides.

### Azure OpenAI

Set an API key plus either a base URL or resource name:

```bash
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://your-resource.ai.azure.com
# Or:
export AZURE_OPENAI_RESOURCE_NAME=your-resource
```

Resource root URLs under `ai.azure.com`, `cognitiveservices.azure.com`, and `openai.azure.com` are normalized to the OpenAI API path.

### Amazon Bedrock

Bedrock can use a bearer token or an ambient AWS credential source:

```bash
# Named profile
export AWS_PROFILE=your-profile

# IAM keys
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
# Required for temporary credentials
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=...

# Bedrock bearer token
export AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK=...

# Region, when not supplied by the profile or AWS SDK configuration
export AWS_REGION=us-west-2
# AWS_DEFAULT_REGION is also supported
```

Pi also supports ECS task credentials and IRSA through the standard `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_*` and `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` variables.

### Cloudflare AI Gateway

The gateway requires a token, account ID, and gateway ID:

```bash
export CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY=...
export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=...
export CLOUDFLARE_GATEWAY_ID=...
```

The account and gateway IDs can come from the process environment or the credential's `env` object in `auth.json`.

`CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` authenticates Pi to the gateway. Upstream access can use Cloudflare unified billing, credentials stored in the gateway, or an `Authorization` header configured for the provider in `models.json`.

### Cloudflare Workers AI

Workers AI requires a token and account ID:

```bash
export CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY=...
export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=...
```

The account ID can also be stored in the credential's `env` object.

### Google Vertex AI

Use a Google Cloud API key:

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY=...
```

To use Application Default Credentials, configure a project and location:

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project
# GCLOUD_PROJECT is also supported
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
```

Then authenticate:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

To use a service-account key file instead, set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` along with the project and location.
