# Skills

Skills are self-contained capability packages that the agent loads on-demand. A skill provides specialized workflows, setup instructions, helper scripts, and reference documentation for specific tasks.

Pi implements the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/specification), warning about most violations but remaining lenient. Pi allows skill names to differ from their parent directory even though the standard disallows it; that rule is suboptimal for shared skill directories used across multiple agent harnesses.

## Locations

> **Security:** Skills can instruct the model to perform any action and may include executable code the model invokes. Review skill content before use.

Pi loads skills from:

- Global:
  - `~/.pi/agent/skills/`
  - `~/.agents/skills/`
- Project (only after the project is trusted):
  - `.pi/skills/`
  - `.agents/skills/` in `cwd` and ancestor directories (up to git repo root, or filesystem root when not in a repo)
- Packages: `skills/` directories or `pi.skills` entries in `package.json`
- Settings: `skills` array with files or directories
- CLI: `--skill <path>` (repeatable, additive even with `--no-skills`)

Discovery rules:
- In `~/.pi/agent/skills/` and `.pi/skills/`, direct root `.md` files are discovered as individual skills
- In all skill locations, directories containing `SKILL.md` are discovered recursively
- In `~/.agents/skills/` and project `.agents/skills/`, root `.md` files are ignored

Disable discovery with `--no-skills` (explicit `--skill` paths still load).

### Using Skills from Other Harnesses

To use skills from Claude Code or OpenAI Codex, add their directories to settings:

```json
{
  "skills": [
    "~/.claude/skills",
    "~/.codex/skills"
  ]
}
```

For project-level Claude Code skills, add to `.pi/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "skills": ["../.claude/skills"]
}
```

## How Skills Work

1. At startup, pi scans skill locations and extracts names and descriptions
2. The system prompt includes available skills in XML format per the [specification](https://agentskills.io/integrate-skills)
3. When a task matches, the agent uses `read` to load the full SKILL.md (models don't always do this; use prompting or `/skill:name` to force it)
4. The agent follows the instructions, using relative paths to reference scripts and assets

This is progressive disclosure: only descriptions are always in context, full instructions load on-demand.

## Skill Commands

Skills register as `/skill:name` commands:

```bash
/skill:brave-search           # Load and execute the skill
/skill:pdf-tools extract      # Load skill with arguments
```

Arguments after the command are appended to the skill content as `User: <args>`.

Toggle skill commands via `/settings` in interactive mode or in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "enableSkillCommands": true
}
```

## Skill Structure

A skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` file. Everything else is freeform.

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md              # Required: frontmatter + instructions
├── scripts/              # Helper scripts
│   └── process.sh
├── references/           # Detailed docs loaded on-demand
│   └── api-reference.md
└── assets/
    └── template.json
```

### SKILL.md Format

````markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when to use it. Be specific.
---

# My Skill

## Setup

Run once before first use:
```bash
cd /path/to/skill && npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
./scripts/process.sh <input>
```
````

Use relative paths from the skill directory:

```markdown
See [the reference guide](references/REFERENCE.md) for details.
```

## Frontmatter

Per the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification#frontmatter-required):

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Max 64 chars. Lowercase a-z, 0-9, hyphens. Unlike the standard, Pi does not require this to match the parent directory because that standard requirement is suboptimal for shared skill directories. |
| `description` | Recommended | Max 1024 chars. What the skill does and when to use it. When omitted, Pi falls back to the first paragraph of the markdown body (Claude Code behavior). |
| `license` | No | License name or reference to bundled file. |
| `compatibility` | No | Max 500 chars. Environment requirements. |
| `metadata` | No | Arbitrary key-value mapping. |
| `allowed-tools` | No | Space-delimited list of pre-approved tools (experimental). |
| `disable-model-invocation` | No | When `true`, skill is hidden from system prompt. Users must use `/skill:name`. |
| `user-invocable` | No | Claude Code field. When `false`, the skill is hidden from `/skill:name` command menus and listings. Defaults to `true`. |
| `when_to_use` | No | Claude Code field. Extra when-to-use guidance, appended to `description` in the system prompt skill listing. |
| `argument-hint` | No | Claude Code field. Hint shown in `/skill:name` autocomplete, e.g. `<pr-url>` or `[issue-number]`. Unquoted bracket forms parse as YAML flow lists and are re-wrapped in brackets per element. |

Boolean frontmatter fields (`disable-model-invocation`, `user-invocable`) accept `true`, `false`, `yes`, `no`, `on`, `off`, `1`, and `0` in any letter case, per Claude Code. Invalid values warn and fall back to the default.

### Claude Code Frontmatter

Skills written for [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills#frontmatter-reference) load in Pi. Pi honors `disable-model-invocation`, `user-invocable`, `when_to_use`, `argument-hint`, the relaxed boolean values, and the description fallback described above.

The remaining Claude Code fields are ignored: `name` (display-only), `arguments` and `$ARGUMENTS` substitution (Pi appends arguments as `User: <args>` instead), `allowed-tools`/`disallowed-tools` (no per-skill tool gating), `model`, `effort`, `context: fork`, `agent`, `background` (no per-skill model, effort, or forked execution), `hooks`, `paths`, and `shell`.

### Name Rules

- 1-64 characters
- Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only
- No leading/trailing hyphens
- No consecutive hyphens
Pi does not require the name to match the parent directory. The Agent Skills standard does, but that requirement is suboptimal for shared skill directories used by multiple tools.

Valid: `pdf-processing`, `data-analysis`, `code-review`
Invalid: `PDF-Processing`, `-pdf`, `pdf--processing`

### Description Best Practices

The description determines when the agent loads the skill. Be specific.

Good:
```yaml
description: Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills PDF forms, and merges multiple PDFs. Use when working with PDF documents.
```

Poor:
```yaml
description: Helps with PDFs.
```

## Validation

Pi validates skills against the Agent Skills standard. Most issues produce warnings but still load the skill:

- Name exceeds 64 characters or contains invalid characters
- Name starts/ends with hyphen or has consecutive hyphens
- Description exceeds 1024 characters
- Boolean fields with invalid values

Unknown frontmatter fields are ignored.

**Exception:** Skills with no usable description are not loaded. When `description` is omitted, Pi falls back to the first paragraph of the markdown body, skipping headings, HTML comments, and fenced code blocks. A skill with neither a frontmatter `description` nor a usable body paragraph is not loaded.

Name collisions (same name from different locations) warn and keep the first skill found.

## Example

```
brave-search/
├── SKILL.md
├── search.js
└── content.js
```

**SKILL.md:**
````markdown
---
name: brave-search
description: Web search and content extraction via Brave Search API. Use for searching documentation, facts, or any web content.
---

# Brave Search

## Setup

```bash
cd /path/to/brave-search && npm install
```

## Search

```bash
./search.js "query"              # Basic search
./search.js "query" --content    # Include page content
```

## Extract Page Content

```bash
./content.js https://example.com
```
